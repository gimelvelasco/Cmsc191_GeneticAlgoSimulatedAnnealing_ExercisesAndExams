Cmsc191 LE1 Notes:

Objectives:
1. The effect of the population size should be demonstrated in the report
2. Experiment on pc = 1.0, 0.9 and 0.8. Determine if simulation results to having advantage for pc < 1.0
3. Determine the appropriate pm by taking declining pm in your simulations.
4. Determine optimal neighbourhood sizes for a PARTICULAR problem.
5. Determine optimal cooling ratio
6. Conclusion should be a detailed analysis on the simulation and the effectiveness of some properties of the hybrid SA.

Test Functions:
1. Same as last exercise. 10 test functions.

Things need to get after the whole run:
1. Best Cooling Ratio
2. Best Popsize per problem
3. Best pm
4. Best pc
5. popsize, runtime, fitness table

Other observations to include in latex:
1. SA's runtime is predictable
2. Algorithm does not get the near the global minimum for functions that has very steep global minimum. Such as Ackley, Easom and Shubert
3. Solution is near at Griewangks, its just that the curvature of the function is very shallow therefore will yield a vast approximations near the global minimum.
